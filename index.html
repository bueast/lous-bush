                        <p2>After sourcing our plants, they remain with us here in the UK <b>for a minimum of 2 months</b> before we consider releasing them to customers. We consider it extremely important to make sure our plants are healthy, pest-free and actively growing before sale.</p2>

                        <p>Around <b>50%</b> of our plants are propagated and grown from our own inventory in the UK, this is due to our sizeable quantity and variety of Mother Plants we have collected and established over the years. In addition, <b>our plants are grown substrate-free</b>, this allows us to efficiently ship plants to other countries. </p>
